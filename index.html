            Henry Madd is a spoken word artist, theatre maker and workshop
            facilitator. After cutting his teeth on the Californian poetry
            circuit he returned to his native England and firmly entrenched
            himself in the poetry community in Kent. He won the 2017 Apples and
            Snakes/ Wise Words Festival Emerging Artist Contest and has since
            gone on to perform around the country. Performance highlights
            include: City 451, Brighton Fringe, Nozstock, CSP in the Park main
            stage and supporting Lemn Sissay in Canterbury Cathedral. He is
            currently developing a one man show based on his experience growing
            us in a small town in the West-Mids, due to start touring Autumn
            2019.

        <h2>Solo Show – Land Of Lost Content/ Come Alive</h2>
        <p>
          Country life is often neglected by mainstream media. There are some
          very real, deep-seated issues in rural communities that are, for the
          most part, un-reported on. However, the themes this collection covers
          are not exclusive to these areas, issues surrounding masculinity,
          abuse and addiction are global. This work does not solely focus on
          these hardships; the goal is not to make you pity the characters you
          encounter but see them as real, intricate people full of hope and
          excitement desperate for new experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show is a glimpse into the lives of my friends and I fighting,
          loving, and smoking our way through adolescence into young adulthood.
          The constant need to prove ourselves, alleviate boredom and grow up
          fast meant that the need to make it out alive fell to the wayside.
          Friendships were forged through shared experiences of failed
          adventures, bad habits and raves. Worlds are turned upside down in an
          instant and yet nothing ever seems to change.

        <p>
          Henry works extensively teaching writing and theatre workshops to
          people of all ages and is passionate about promoting writing for
          wellbeing. He runs various community poetry projects designed to
          encourage people to connect with each other and the places they call
          home. Henry combines his theatre background with his writing teaching
          practice to get words up on their feet keeping writing exciting and
          relevant.

        <q
          >At school, I didn’t get poetry and saw writing as a chore, I could
          never imagine doing it for leisure. Now I love it and couldn’t live
          without it, I want everyone else to share that feeling. You don’t have
          to be good at spelling or have perfect grammar (I am the prime example
          of this) to be a writer, you just need to find your voice and say
          whatever it is you want to say.
